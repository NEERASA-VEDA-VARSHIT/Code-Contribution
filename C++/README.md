# C++ Directory

This directory contains C++ code examples and algorithms. Each file demonstrates a specific concept or algorithm in C++.

## List of Files

- `binarySearch.cpp`: Implementation of binary search algorithm.
- `CP-template.cpp`: A template for competitive programming in C++.
- `hello-world.cpp`: A simple "Hello, World!" program in C++.
- `primes.cpp`: Program to calculate prime numbers in a given range.
- `segmentTreeForSum.cpp`: Implementation of a segment tree for sum queries.

## How to Run the Code

To compile and run any of the C++ programs, use the following commands:

```bash
g++ -o output filename.cpp
./output
```

Replace `filename.cpp` with the name of the file you want to compile and run.
