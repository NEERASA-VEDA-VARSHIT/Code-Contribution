# Kotlin Directory

This directory contains Kotlin code examples and exercises. Each file demonstrates a specific concept or functionality in Kotlin.

## Files

- `hello-world.kt`: A simple "Hello, World!" program in Kotlin.

## How to Run

To run the Kotlin programs in this directory, you need to have Kotlin installed on your machine. You can download and install Kotlin from the official [Kotlin website](https://kotlinlang.org/).

Once Kotlin is installed, you can run the programs using the following command:

```bash
kotlinc <filename>.kt -include-runtime -d <output>.jar
java -jar <output>.jar
```

Replace `<filename>` with the name of the Kotlin file you want to run and `<output>` with the desired name for the output JAR file.
