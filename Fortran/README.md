# Fortran Directory

This directory contains Fortran programs. Below is a brief description of each file:

## Files

- `hello-world.f`: A simple "Hello, World!" program in Fortran.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any of the Fortran programs, use the following commands:

```sh
gfortran filename.f -o outputfile
./outputfile
```

Replace `filename.f` with the name of the Fortran file you want to compile, and `outputfile` with the desired name of the executable.

## Contribution Guidelines

Feel free to add more Fortran programs to this directory. Make sure to update this `README.md` file with a brief description of the new programs you add.
